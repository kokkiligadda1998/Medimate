## Overview
**MediMate** is a specialized NLP framework designed for the extraction and identification of key medical entities from clinical transcriptions. Using advanced NLP techniques and the SpaCy library, this project enhances the efficiency of medical document processing, aiding healthcare professionals by highlighting critical patient information.

## Objectives
- **Automate Entity Recognition**: Automatically identify and categorize key entities in medical texts to save time and reduce manual effort for healthcare practitioners.
- **Improve Data Accessibility**: Make crucial information readily accessible, supporting faster decision-making and more accurate patient care planning.

## Data
The project utilizes the **MACCROBAT2020** dataset, consisting of 200 annotated medical documents, enabling comprehensive training and evaluation of the NER model.

## Features
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies entities such as medications, symptoms, and diagnoses.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Interprets the context around identified entities for better understanding.
- **Visualization**: Highlights entities directly in the transcription text for easy review.
